# Diagrams

## Language of the Diagrams
Diagrams must be written in English. This includes all element names, descriptive texts, and any annotations within the diagram. The use of English ensures that diagrams are understandable to a global audience and facilitates international collaboration on technical and software projects.

## Size and Orientation of Diagrams

Diagrams should have a size of 1920x1080 pixels and a horizontal orientation. This ensures that the diagrams are large enough to be legible and fit most screens and presentations.

## Format of the Diagrams

Diagrams should be exported in PNG format. This format is widely compatible and maintains the image quality necessary for presentations and documentation.

## Typography of the Diagrams

Diagrams should use the "Roboto" typeface in its different variants. This font is modern, legible, and widely used in applications and websites, making it suitable for technical diagrams.

## Style of the Diagrams

Diagrams should follow a clean and professional style. This includes the use of clear lines, consistent colors, and an orderly arrangement of elements. Unnecessary visual effects that might distract from the diagram's content should be avoided.

## Elements of the Diagrams

Diagrams should include the following elements:

  - **Actors**: Represented by human figures or icons indicating who interacts with the system.
  - **Use Cases**: Represented by ovals indicating system functionalities from the user's perspective.
  - **Activities**: Represented by rectangles with rounded edges, indicating actions or processes within the system.
  - **Classes**: Represented by rectangles divided into sections, indicating attributes and methods of the system's classes.
  - **Components**: Represented by rectangles with thicker borders, indicating parts of the system that encapsulate functionality.
  - **Packages**: Represented by rectangles with a tab at the top, indicating groupings of classes or components.
  - **Nodes**: Represented by rectangles or circles, indicating infrastructure elements like servers or devices.
  - **Interface**: Represented by rectangles with a dotted border, indicating system interaction points.
  - **Data Store / Database**: Represented by cylinders, indicating persistent data storage.
  - **System Boundary**: Represented by a large rectangle containing all system elements, indicating the system's scope.
  - **Notes**: Represented by rectangles with rounded corners, indicating additional information or clarifications about the diagram.
  - **Borders**: Use clear and defined lines to separate diagram elements.
  - **Font**: Use a legible and professional typeface, such as "Roboto," for all text in the diagram.
