# Eventuality â€“ Unified Event Subscription Data Flow (Verbal Description, Expanded)

This document provides a comprehensive, step-by-step, and pedagogical explanation of the unified event subscription logic as represented in the "Eventuality - Unified Subscription Flow" diagram. The description is designed so that, by following this logic, you can reproduce a functionally identical diagram in any language or tool, and also implement the exact same algorithm in any programming language.

---

## 1. Entry Point: Subscribing to an Event

The process starts when a **Subscriber** calls the `subscribe(eventType, handler, cluster)` method on the **Eventuality** system.

- `eventType`: The type of event the handler is interested in.
- `handler`: The callback function to be invoked when the event occurs.
- `cluster`: The cluster name (string) to which the handler subscribes. This can be a specific name or the wildcard `'*'`.

---

## 2. Check for Existing Handler (Duplicate Subscription Handling)

The system checks if there is already a handler registered for the same `eventType` and with the same handler identity (reference or id).

- **If such a handler exists:**
  - The system updates the cluster associated with this handler and eventType, replacing the previous cluster value with the new one provided in the subscription.
- **If such a handler does not exist:**
  - The system registers the new handler for the given eventType and cluster.

---

## 3. Persisted Events Check

After updating or registering the handler, the system checks if there are any **persisted events** that match the subscription criteria.

- The system searches its persisted events store for events where:
  - `event.eventType == eventType`
  - AND (`event.cluster == cluster` OR `cluster == '*'` OR `event.cluster == '*'`)

---

## 4. Delivering Persisted Events

- **If matching persisted events are found:**
  - For each matching persisted event, the system invokes the handler's callback, passing the event as an argument (possibly asynchronously).
- **If no matching persisted events are found:**
  - The process ends; the handler will only be invoked for future events.

---

## 5. End of Flow

- Once all matching persisted events (if any) have been delivered to the handler, the subscription process is complete.

---

## 6. Pseudocode Summary

Below is a pseudocode summary of the above logic:

```pseudocode
function subscribe(eventType, handler, cluster):
    // 1. Check for existing handler for this eventType
    if handler_exists(eventType, handler):
        // 2. Update cluster for this handler and eventType
        update_handler_cluster(eventType, handler, cluster)
    else:
        // 3. Register new handler
        register_handler(eventType, handler, cluster)

    // 4. Check for matching persisted events
    matching_events = [
        event for event in persisted_events
        if event.eventType == eventType and (
            event.cluster == cluster or
            cluster == '*' or
            event.cluster == '*'
        )
    ]

    // 5. Deliver persisted events if any
    for event in matching_events:
        handler(event)

    // 6. Done
```

---

## 7. Implementation Notes

- The logic ensures that duplicate subscriptions (same eventType and handler) do not create multiple registrations, but instead update the cluster as needed.
- The wildcard cluster `'*'` acts as a global subscription, both for event clusters and handler clusters.
- The process is deterministic and can be implemented in any language or system that supports basic data structures and control flow.

By following this description, you can reproduce the unified event subscription flow in any diagramming tool or implement the logic in any programming language.
