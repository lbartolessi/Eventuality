# Eventuality System - Implementation Plan

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose of this Document

This document outlines a structured plan for the implementation or completion of the `Eventuality` event bus system. It breaks down the development process into manageable phases and tasks, drawing upon the existing detailed documentation (Requirements, Architecture, Use Cases, and TSDoc). This plan is intended to guide development, ensure all requirements are met, and facilitate project tracking.

### 1.2 Project Goal

To develop and deliver a robust, type-safe, and efficient `Eventuality` event bus system that fully complies with all specified Functional Requirements (FRs) and Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs), as detailed in the project's documentation.

## 2. Methodology Considerations

This implementation plan is presented in a phased manner, which provides a clear, sequential structure. However, it can be adapted to various development methodologies.

### 2.1 Phased (Waterfall-like) Approach

The plan is naturally structured in phases, where each phase builds upon the previous one.

* **Pros:**
  * Clear structure and well-defined stages.
  * Good for projects with stable and well-understood requirements.
  * Easier to track progress against a predefined baseline.
  * Documentation at each stage is typically thorough.
* **Cons:**
  * Can be rigid and less adaptable to changes or discoveries made mid-project.
  * Testing often occurs later in the lifecycle.
  * Risk of delivering a product that doesn't fully meet evolving user needs if feedback loops are long.

### 2.2 Iterative/Agile Adaptation

The phases and tasks outlined below can be adapted to an iterative or Agile methodology (e.g., Scrum, Kanban).

* **How this plan fits:**
  * **Epics:** The main phases (e.g., "Core Publishing and Subscription," "Event Persistence") can be treated as high-level Epics.
  * **User Stories/Tasks:** The individual tasks within each phase can be broken down further into smaller user stories or tasks suitable for sprints or a Kanban board.
  * **Prioritization:** Tasks can be prioritized within and across phases based on dependencies and value. For instance, core functionality from Phase 1 would likely be prioritized for early iterations.
  * **Incremental Delivery:** An Agile approach would aim to deliver working subsets of functionality (e.g., basic publish/subscribe) earlier.
* **Pros:**
  * Increased flexibility and adaptability to change.
  * Early and continuous feedback from stakeholders.
  * Improved risk management by tackling high-risk items earlier.
  * Potentially faster delivery of a Minimum Viable Product (MVP).
* **Cons:**
  * Requires active stakeholder involvement and clear communication.
  * Can lead to scope creep if not managed carefully.
  * Planning is more continuous and less "up-front."

**Recommendation:** For the `Eventuality` system, given the detailed existing specifications, a hybrid approach might be effective. The defined phases provide a solid roadmap, while an iterative approach to implementing tasks within those phases can offer flexibility and allow for early testing and refinement of core components.

## 3. Implementation Phases

    * Automatic subscription to the `targetEvent` (FR1.9.1, FR1.9.2, FR1.9.4).
    * Publication of the `REQUEST_EVENT` (FR1.9.5).
    * Ensure `REQUEST_EVENT` is always persisted (FR1.7.5).

  * **Deliverables:** Distribution-ready package.

## 4. Key Deliverables Summary

* Fully implemented and tested `Eventuality` system (`src/Eventuality.ts`, `src/decorators.ts`).
* Comprehensive unit and integration test suite.
* Complete TSDoc for all public APIs.
* Updated and accurate Markdown documentation suite.
* (Optional) Distributable package.

## 5. Assumptions

* The development environment (`package.json` scripts, TypeScript, Vitest) is functional.
* The scope is limited to the features and behaviors described in the `Eventuality` documentation.

## 6. Next Steps (To be completed by the project owner/team)

* **Resource Allocation:** Assign developers/team members to tasks/phases.
* **Timeline Estimation:** Estimate effort and duration for each task and phase.
* **Milestone Definition:** Define key project milestones.
* **Risk Assessment:** Identify potential risks and mitigation strategies.
* **Communication Plan:** Establish how progress and issues will be communicated.
