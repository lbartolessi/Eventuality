# Project/Feature Name

## 1. Introduction and Objectives

* **Purpose:** (Brief description of the software, what problem it solves, and for whom.)
* **Key Objectives:** (Specific goals the software must achieve. E.g., Improve efficiency in X, Reduce errors in Y.)
* **Document Audience:** (Who this document is intended for: developers, testers, stakeholders, AI, etc.)

## 2. Scope

* **In-Scope:**
  * Main functionality 1
  * Main functionality 2
  * ...
* **Out-of-Scope:** (What will explicitly NOT be done)
  * Functionality A
  * Integration with system B
  * ...

## 3. Glossary of Terms (Optional but Recommended)

* **Term 1:** Clear and concise definition.
* **Term 2:** Clear and concise definition.
  * *(This helps avoid ambiguities, for both humans and AI.)*

## 4. Functional Requirements (FR)

*(Describe what the system *must do*)*

* **FR-001: Descriptive Requirement Title**
  * **Description:** (User story format is very useful here: "As a [type of user], I want to [perform an action] so that [I can achieve a benefit/goal].")
  * **Acceptance Criteria (AC):** (Conditions that must be met for the requirement to be considered satisfactorily implemented. Very useful for AI when generating tests.)
    * AC-001.1: The system must allow X.
    * AC-001.2: If Y occurs, the system must respond with Z.
    * *(Optionally, you can use Gherkin format here for greater clarity and test automation):*
    * **Scenario:** Scenario Title
      * **Given** [an initial context or precondition]
      * **When** [an action is performed by the user or system]
      * **Then** [an observable and expected outcome occurs]
* **FR-002: Descriptive Requirement Title**
  * **Description:** ...
  * **Acceptance Criteria:** ...

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements (NFR)

*(Describe *how* the system should be or the qualities it must possess. E.g., performance, security, usability, maintainability)*

* **NFR-001: Performance - Main Page Load**
  * **Description:** The main page must load in less than X seconds with Y concurrent users.
  * **Metric:** Load time < Xs for 95% of requests.
* **NFR-002: Security - User Authentication**
  * **Description:** All passwords must be stored hashed using [specific algorithm].
* **NFR-003: Usability - Intuitive Navigation**
  * **Description:** A new user should be able to complete [key task] in less than [time] without external help.

## 6. Use Cases (Optional but very useful for AI)

*(Describes specific interactions between users (actors) and the system to achieve a goal)*

* **UC-001: Use Case Name (e.g., Register New User)**
  * **Actor(s):** Unregistered User.
  * **Preconditions:** The user is on the registration page.
  * **Main Flow (Steps):**
        1. The user enters their name.
        2. The user enters their email address.
        3. The user enters their password and confirms it.
        4. The user clicks "Register".
        5. The system validates the data.
        6. The system creates the account and redirects the user to the dashboard.
  * **Alternative Flows/Exceptions:**
    * **AF-1 (Email already exists):** If the email is already registered, the system displays an error message.
    * **EXC-1 (Validation error):** If the data is invalid, the system displays specific error messages per field.
  * **Postconditions:** The user is registered and authenticated, or an appropriate error message is displayed.

## 7. UI/UX Design (Sketches, Wireframes, or Descriptions)

*(If applicable, you can link images, describe screen flows, or key interactions. For AI, detailed textual descriptions are valuable if images are not available)*

* **Login Screen:**
  * Fields: Username, Password.
  * Buttons: Login, Forgot Password?.
* **Purchase Flow:**
    1. Product selection.
    2. Add to cart.
    3. View cart.
    4. Checkout (shipping details, payment).
    5. Confirmation.

## 8. Data Model (Logical Description or Link to Diagram)

*(If relevant, describe the main data entities and their relationships. For AI, this helps generate class models, DB schemas, etc.)*

* **User Entity:** (id, name, email, password_hash, creation_date)
* **Product Entity:** (id, name, description, price, stock, category_id)
* **Relationship:** A User can have many Orders. An Order belongs to a User.

## 9. Technology Stack (Proposed or Constraints)

*(Information about languages, frameworks, databases, etc. This guides the AI if you ask it to generate code.)*

* **Frontend:** React, TypeScript
* **Backend:** Python (Django/Flask)
* **Database:** PostgreSQL
* **Infrastructure:** AWS (EC2, S3, RDS)
* **Constraints:** Must be compatible with API X, Do not use library Y.

## 10. Additional Considerations / Open Questions

*(Any other information, assumptions, or points needing clarification.)*
