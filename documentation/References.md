# References for Eventuality Project

This document serves as a compilation of references and resources related to the Eventuality project. It includes links to external documentation, related projects, and other materials that provide additional context or information about the system.

## External Documentation

- [TypeScript Documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/): Eventuality is implemented in TypeScript, leveraging its strong typing and interface features for robust event modeling.
- [JavaScript Event Loop](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/EventLoop): Understanding the event loop is crucial for grasping how Eventuality processes events asynchronously and manages the event queue.
- [Design Patterns in JavaScript](https://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/): Eventuality applies patterns such as Publish-Subscribe, Singleton, and Request-Response, which are explained in this resource.
- [Event Sourcing](https://martinfowler.com/eaa.html#EventSourcing): The concept of persisting events for late subscribers in Eventuality is inspired by event sourcing principles.
- [Publish-Subscribe Pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish–subscribe_pattern): The core mechanism of Eventuality is based on this pattern, enabling decoupled communication between components.

## Related Projects

- [RxJS](https://rxjs.dev/) - A library for reactive programming using Observables, which can be used for event handling. Eventuality offers a simpler, type-safe alternative for event-driven architectures.
- [Node.js EventEmitter](https://nodejs.org/api/events.html#events_class_eventemitter) - A Node.js module that provides an implementation of the event emitter pattern. Eventuality extends this idea with clusters, persistence, and strong typing.
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) - A predictable state container for JavaScript apps, which can be integrated with event-driven architectures. Eventuality can be used alongside Redux for event-based state changes.

## Additional Resources

- [Eventuality GitHub Repository](https://github.com/yourusername/eventuality) - The source code and issue tracker for the Eventuality project. Here you can find the latest updates, report issues, and contribute.
