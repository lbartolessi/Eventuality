# Design Document for Eventuality

## 1. Introduction

This Design Document provides a comprehensive overview of the software design for the Eventuality system. It outlines the design specifications, class diagrams, and descriptions of the core components and their responsibilities. The document also discusses the design decisions made during the development process and how they address the requirements outlined in the Requirements Document.

## 2. Design Overview

The Eventuality system is designed as a modular, type-safe event bus that facilitates decoupled communication within web applications. The design emphasizes flexibility, scalability, and ease of integration with various components, particularly web components.

### 2.1 Key Design Principles

- **Modularity:** The system is composed of distinct modules that can be developed, tested, and maintained independently.
- **Type Safety:** Leveraging TypeScript ensures that events and handlers are defined with clear types, reducing runtime errors.
- **Asynchronous Processing:** The design supports non-blocking operations, allowing the application to remain responsive during event handling.
- **Extensibility:** The architecture allows for future enhancements and integrations without significant refactoring.

## 3. Core Components

### 3.1 Eventuality Class

The `Eventuality` class serves as the core facade for the event bus. It manages the singleton instance and orchestrates interactions between various internal components.

#### Responsibilities

- Manage event publishing and subscription.
- Handle event persistence and retrieval.
- Provide a public API for external components to interact with the event bus.

### 3.2 Event Definitions

The system defines several key event types, including:

- `BaseEvent<D>`: The base structure for all events, containing metadata and event-specific data.
- `RequestEvent<D>`: A specialized event type for handling request-response patterns.

### 3.3 Subscription Management

The subscription management component is responsible for:

- Registering and unregistering event handlers.
- Ensuring handler uniqueness and managing clusters for targeted event delivery.

### 3.4 Persistence Manager

The persistence manager handles:

- Storing events for late subscribers.
- Retrieving persisted events based on subscription criteria.

## 5. Design Decisions

### 5.1 Singleton Pattern

The `Eventuality` class is implemented as a singleton to ensure a single point of interaction for all event-related operations. This design choice simplifies the management of event subscriptions and processing.

### 5.2 Asynchronous Event Processing

The system employs an asynchronous processing model to handle events without blocking the main application thread. This decision enhances the responsiveness of applications utilizing the Eventuality system.

### 5.3 Error Handling Strategy

A robust error handling strategy is implemented to manage exceptions during event processing. This includes logging errors and providing fallback mechanisms for critical operations.

## 6. Design of Eventuality

### Patterns Used

- **Singleton**: Only one instance of the event bus by default.
- **Publish-Subscribe**: Decouples event producers and consumers.
- **Request-Response**: Supports request events with custom handlers.

### Class Structure

- `Eventuality`: Main class, manages event queue, subscriptions, persistence.
- `BaseEvent<T>`: Interface for events.
- `EventHandler<T>`: Interface for handlers.
- `EventualityLogger`: Internal logger for debug mode.

### Singleton Example

```typescript
const bus1 = Eventuality.getInstance();
const bus2 = Eventuality.getInstance();
console.assert(bus1 === bus2); // true
```

### Persistence Example

```typescript
// Publish with persistence
eventuality.publish(event, new Set(['main']), true);
// Late subscriber receives the event immediately
eventuality.subscribe(event, handler, 'main');
```

### Error Handling Example

```typescript
const bus = Eventuality.getInstance({
  handleError: (err, event) => {
    console.error('Custom error:', err, event.eventType);
  }
});
```

## 7. Conclusion

The design of the Eventuality system is focused on providing a flexible, type-safe, and efficient event bus for web applications. By adhering to key design principles and making informed design decisions, the system is well-equipped to meet the functional and non-functional requirements outlined in the Requirements Document. Future enhancements and integrations can be accommodated within this design framework, ensuring the longevity and adaptability of the Eventuality system.
