# Requirements Document: Eventuality System

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

The purpose of this Requirements Document is to outline the functional and non-functional requirements for the Eventuality system. This document serves as a foundation for understanding what the system should accomplish and the constraints under which it must operate.

### 1.2 Scope

This document covers the following aspects of the Eventuality system:

- Functional requirements detailing the features and capabilities of the system.
- Non-functional requirements addressing performance, security, and usability.
- User characteristics that define the target audience for the system.
- Assumptions and dependencies that impact the system's design and implementation.

## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Product Perspective

Eventuality is designed as a modular event bus system that facilitates decoupled communication between various components of web applications. It operates as a singleton and supports a publish-subscribe model, asynchronous processing, event persistence, and clustering.

### 2.2 Product Features

- **Event Definition and Typing:** The system allows for the definition of events with specific types and associated data.
- **Publishing and Subscribing:** Components can publish events to the bus and subscribe to specific event types.
- **Event Persistence:** The system can persist events for later retrieval by late subscribers.
- **Asynchronous Processing:** Events are processed asynchronously to ensure non-blocking operations.
- **Debug Mode:** A debug mode is available for tracing and logging event handling.
- **Singleton Management:** The Eventuality system is managed as a singleton instance.

### 2.3 User Characteristics

- **Developers:** Users integrating Eventuality into their applications will utilize the Eventuality API.
- **System Components:** Components acting as publishers or subscribers will interact with the Eventuality system.

### 2.4 Constraints

- The system is designed for a TypeScript/JavaScript environment, utilizing type annotations and interfaces.
- The architecture assumes the use of in-memory storage for events, with potential for future persistence mechanisms.
- The design must accommodate asynchronous operations, ensuring that event handling does not block the main application thread.

### 2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies

- **Asynchronous Operations:** Many operations, such as event handling and delivery, are asynchronous in nature.
- **Singleton Pattern:** The Eventuality system is implemented as a singleton, ensuring a single instance manages all event bus operations.
- **Handler Uniqueness:** The system checks for duplicate handlers based on object references for a given event type.

## 3. Specific Requirements

### 3.1 Functional Requirements

- **FR1:** The system shall allow components to publish events to the event bus.
- **FR2:** The system shall allow components to subscribe to specific event types.
- **FR3:** The system shall deliver persisted events to new subscribers upon registration.
- **FR4:** The system shall support asynchronous event processing.
- **FR5:** The system shall provide a debug mode for logging event handling.
- Must allow publishing events with type and payload.
- Must allow subscribing/unsubscribing handlers to event types and clusters.
- Must persist events for late subscribers if requested.
- Must support custom error handling.
- Must support debug logging and configurable wait timeout.
- Must enforce that a handler instance is only registered for one event type at a time.

### 3.2 Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR1:** The system shall ensure high availability and reliability in event delivery.
- **NFR2:** The system shall maintain a response time of less than 100 milliseconds for event processing.
- **NFR3:** The system shall provide comprehensive documentation for developers.
- Type safety for all events and handlers.
- Singleton pattern for main event bus instance.
- Efficient, non-blocking event delivery (configurable with `waitTimeout`).
- Clear error messages for invalid operations (e.g., duplicate handler registration).
